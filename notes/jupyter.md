# Jupyter and Computer Programming
Throughout this course, we will use *Jupyter* notebooks to explore the material. Your first assignment(s) will provide you with some basic background in *Jupyter* and *Python*. (I had been hoping to use *Julia*, which is arguably easier, but the online tools available at McMaster seem not to support *Julia*.)

Your first assignment is to use a *Python* *Jupyter* notebook which demos the grading scheme for the class. The basic steps, which are demonstrated in the below video tutorial, are:
1. Log into [syzygy.ca](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/). This is a *JupyterHub*.
2. Open the notebook provided via `nbgitpuller` by clicking the link.
3. Complete the assignment at the bottom of the file.
4. Submit your notebook to  

Please refer to the assignments on Python, Numpy, and Jupyter for further training. 

You may also wish to complete extra-credit assignments.
