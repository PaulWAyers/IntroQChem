## Extra Credit

Extra credit problems should be sent to the instructor in a private chat message via Microsoft Teams.

1. [Basics of Jupyter, Python, and Programming](extracredit/programming.md).
1. Problems from Randy Dumont's [book](documents/DumontBook.pdf) and his [course](extracredit/DumontProblems.pdf).
1. Problem Sets from Jack Simons' and Jeff Nichols' [Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/TheoryPage/BookPDF/TableofContents.html)
1. [Problems](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/ITCSecondEdition/Problems.pdf) from Jack Simons' [An Introduction to Theoretical Chemistry, 2nd edition](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/ITCSecondEdition/TableofContents.html).
1. Problems from many other quantum chemistry textbooks are also acceptable. These are not (to my knowledge) legally available free online, though you can try [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub), and there are occasionally other links (of likewise questionable [legality](http://www.nanoer.net/d/img/Molecular%20Quantum%20Mechanics,%205th%20Edition.pdf) and [permanence](http://www.dll.cheminfinity.com/arks/wp-file/books/Ira-N.Levine-Quantum-Chemistry-Pearson-(2013)-cheminfinity.com.pdf)). Good examples are:
    - [Quantum Chemistry](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Levine-Quantum-Chemistry-7th-Edition/PGM78512.html) by Ira Levine
    - [Quantum Chemistry](http://www.mcquarriegeneralchemistry.com/mcqqc2.htm) by Donald McQuarrie

Answer keys are sometimes, but not always, provided.
1. Old [assignments](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChem/tree/main/extracredit/assignments?raw=true), [quizzes](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChem/tree/main/extracredit/quizzes?raw=true), [exams](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChem/tree/main/extracredit/exams?raw=true), and [problems](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChem/tree/main/extracredit/problems?raw=true) from previous iterations of this course and related courses at McMaster. Answer keys are often, but not always, provided (often after a blank version of the assignment/assessment that you can use to practice).
1. You can turn in answers to the various questions that appear in the course notes, or in other [materials](documents/LinAlgAnalogy.pdf) I post online.

## Reference Materials
Materials from McMaster (my notes and Randy Dumont's [book](documents/DumontBook.pdf)) are likely to be especially helpful. The [introductory](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/ITCSecondEdition/TableofContents.html) and [more advanced](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/TheoryPage/BookPDF/TableofContents.html) textbooks from [Jack Simons](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/) are likewise excellent. The (free) [Coursera course from John Daily](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-mechanics#syllabus) mirrors the content of this course, albeit with less depth.

## Other resources

Keys to assignments are not always available. But where available, instructors can join the (private) GitHub with the answer keys by e-mailing Paul Ayers, <ayers@mcmaster.ca>, from your official e-mail account. Where possible, `nbgrader` can be used to mark assignments. New contributions to the problem bank are most welcome too!
