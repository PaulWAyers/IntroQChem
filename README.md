## Assignments

Your assignments will be turned in using Microsoft Teams. For instructions on how to turn in an assignment with Microsoft Teams, see the [webpage](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-in-an-assignment-in-microsoft-teams-e25f383a-b747-4a0b-b6d5-a2845a52092b).

1. [Introduction to Jupyter](assignments/Jupyter.md).
2. [Basic Python](assignments/python.md).
3. [Introduction to Numpy](assignments/numpy.md).
4. [Exploring the classes's marking scheme with Jupyter, Python, Numpy, and syzygy](assignments/syzygy.md).

## Extra Credit

Extra credit problems should be sent in a private chat message with the instructor on Microsoft Teams.

1. [Basics of Jupyter, Python, and Programming](extracredit/programming.md).
1. Problem Sets from Jack Simons' and Jeff Nichols' [Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/TheoryPage/BookPDF/TableofContents.html)
1. [Problems](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/ITCSecondEdition/Problems.pdf) from Jack Simons' [An Introduction to Theoretical Chemistry, 2nd edition](http://simons.hec.utah.edu/ITCSecondEdition/TableofContents.html).
1. Problems from many other quantum chemistry textbooks are also acceptable. These are not (to my knowledge) legally available free online, though you can try [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub), and there are occassionally other links (of likewise questionable [legality](http://www.nanoer.net/d/img/Molecular%20Quantum%20Mechanics,%205th%20Edition.pdf) and [permanence](http://www.dll.cheminfinity.com/arks/wp-file/books/Ira-N.Levine-Quantum-Chemistry-Pearson-(2013)-cheminfinity.com.pdf)) Good examples are:
    - [Quantum Chemistry](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Levine-Quantum-Chemistry-7th-Edition/PGM78512.html) by Ira Levine
    - [Quantum Chemistry](http://www.mcquarriegeneralchemistry.com/mcqqc2.htm) by Donald McQuarrie
    - [Molecular Quantum Mechanics](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/molecular-quantum-mechanics-9780199541423?cc=ca&lang=en&) by Peter Atkins and Ronald Friedman
1. Relevant problem sets or old exam problems from [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/). See specifically the courses on quantum chemistry from [2005](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-73-introductory-quantum-mechanics-i-fall-2005/), [2007](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-61-physical-chemistry-fall-2007/), [2013](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/120336), [2017](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-61-physical-chemistry-fall-2017/), and [2018](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-73-quantum-mechanics-i-fall-2018/).
