# Problems in Quantum Fundamentals

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChemProblems/blob/main/ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb?raw=true) has problems related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. You can also access this notebook at [syzygy](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&depth=1) or on [binder](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/paulwayers-introqchemproblems-ax9n28q6/notebooks/ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb). External to McMaster, you can use binder or this alternative [syzygy link](https://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&depth=1). 

Sometimes the above links for syzygy and/or binder may fail because you have existing files in your directory that conflict with the files that are being downloaded and `nbgitpuller` can't figure out how to merge the disparate copies. In this case, possible solutions are:
1. Directly download the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChemProblems/blob/main/ipynb/IntroQM2021.ipynb) and open it by logging into [mcmaster.syzygy.ca](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/) or [pims.syzygy.ca](https://pims.syzygy.ca/). 
2. Manually pull in the file you want directly from Github. There are instructions about how to do this on the syzygy web site.
3. Keep a directory with the "raw" files I post online, and then a "working" directory with the files you use. You can automatically download files into a reference directory by using the links for [McMaster](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&targetPath=raw) or [elsewhere](https://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulWAyers%2FIntroQChemProblems&urlpath=tree%2FIntroQChemProblems%2Fipynb%2FIntroQM2021.ipynb&branch=main&targetPath=raw).
