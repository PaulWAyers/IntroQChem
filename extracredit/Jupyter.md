## Additional Testing Resources
Here are some online tests to see how much you know, or don't know, about basic Python:
- [Python Exercises from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp) This is a set of 95 simple interactive questions (with answers) on basic concepts that are grouped together based on the topic. It should take no more than 30 minutes for you to answer all questions. 
Instructions: Try to solve an exercise by filling in the missing parts of code. If you got stuck, hit the "Show Answer" button to see what you've done wrong. If you need to practice a certain topic more, you can click on “Go to XXX Tutorial” (where XXX is the topic being tested) for an interactive tutorial to learn more about the topic from W3Schools.

-	Python Quiz from W3Schools (25 multiple-choice questions with no time limit):
https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=PYTHON
Instructions: The test contains 25 questions with no time limit (but it should not take you more than 5 minutes to finish it). You get 1 point for each correct answer, and your total score and the correct answers will be displayed at the end of the quiz.

-	Python Quizzes: (14 topic-specific quizzes each with around 12-15 questions with no time limit)
https://pynative.com/python-quizzes/
Instructions: Click on “Solve Quiz” to test your knowledge on each topic. Upon submitting, your score, correct answers are displayed.

-	Interactive Python Quizzes from Real Python: https://realpython.com/quizzes/
This provides a collection of short interactive quizzes (with answers and no time limit). Some of the quizzes (like “Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python”) test topics that were not covered in our course, so you can skip those.

-	Python Online Quiz (10 multiple-choice questions with no time limit)
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_online_quiz.htm

While some of these questions are a little too simple and easy, they test your basic knowledge of Python which is key in answering more elaborate questions.
