    "![Solvay Conference](https://github.com/PaulWAyers/IntroQChem/blob/main/linkedFiles/SolvayBerny.jfif?raw=true \"The 1927 Solvay Conference on PHOTONS AND ELECTRONS featured debates on quantum mechanics and, of course, Bernie's mittens. It is mused that this pictures has the highest-average-IQ and most-boring-ever-fashion of any picture ever taken. Your political persuasion and personal style will affect your opinion of how the Bernie-meme-ization of the photo affects the IQ, but his timeless mittens unquestionably improves its fashionability.\")"
