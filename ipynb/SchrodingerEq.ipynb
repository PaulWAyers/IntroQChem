    "## Motivation for the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation\n",
    "Just like Newton’s equations or Maxwell’s equations, the Schrödinger equation is a law of nature:  it cannot be “derived.”  Instead, it must be postulated, and then tested by experiment.  However, just as Newton’s equations can be justified insofar as they encapsulate the “laws of motion” formulated by Galileo and Newton, and Maxwell’s equations can be justified insofar as they encapsulate the “laws of electromagnetism” formulated by Gauss, Faraday, Coulomb, etc., Schr&ouml;dinger's equation can be justified by observing that it encapsulates the “laws” of Planck and De Broglie, namely that\n",
    "$$ E = h \\nu = \\hbar \\omega $$\n",
    "$$ p = \\tfrac{h}{\\lambda} = \\tfrac{h \\nu}{c} = \\hbar k = h \\tilde{\\nu} $$\n",
    "In these equations I have introduced several new symbols, mostly related to the fact it is often convenient to use angular frequency, \n",
    "$$ \\omega = 2 \\pi \\nu $$\n",
    "which naturally pairs with \n",
    "$$ \\hbar = \\tfrac{h}{2 \\pi} $$\n",
    "Similarly, it is often convenient, especially in spectroscopic studies, to use wavenumber,\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tfrac{1}{\\lambda} = \\lambda^{-1} $$\n",
    "or its angular analogue\n",
    "$$ k = \\tfrac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} = 2 \\pi \\tilde{nu} $$\n",
    "Sometimes it is also useful to consider the period of the wave, \n",
    "$$ \\text{T}  = \\nu^{-1} $$\n",
    "Recall that the wavelength, frequency, period, and wavenumber of a wave can be related to the speed of light by relations like:\n",

    "### Plane Waves\n",
    "The use of angular frequency and wave number is especially useful when dealing with waves, because the need to explicitly include factors of $2 \\pi$ to describe the periodic oscillations is removed. A one-dimensional plane wave, moving in the $x$ direction, with amplitude $A$, wavelength $\\lambda = \\tfrac{2 \\pi}{k}$, and frequency $\\nu = \\tfrac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}$ is described by\n",
    "$$ \\Psi(x,t) = A e^{i (kx - \\omega t)} = A\\left(\\cos(kx-\\omega t) + i \\sin(kx - \\omega t) \\right) $$\n",
    "Since $\\Psi(x,t)$ is the function that describes a wave, we call it a \"wavefunction.\" Based on electromagnetism, we believe this equation should give us the essential insight we need to describe the \"waviness of particles.\" We need, however, a second equation that will allow us to describe the \"particulateness of waves.\" Since the energy of a wave is proportional to $\\omega$ (Planck-Einstein relation) and the momentum of a wave is proportional to $k$ (De Broglie relation), an equation that relates the energy to the momentum is an obvious candidate. For example,\n",

Can you justify why the quantum mechanical momentum operator is $\\hat{p} = -i \\hbar \\nabla$?\n",

How would you answer this question?"
