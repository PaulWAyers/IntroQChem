# Demonstration of Jupyter Workflow with `Syzygy`

Your first assignment is to use a *Python* *Jupyter* notebook which demos the grading scheme for the class using *Numpy*. The basic steps, which are demonstrated in the below video tutorial, are:

1. Log into [syzygy.ca](https://mcmaster.syzygy.ca/). This is a *JupyterHub*.
2. Open the notebook provided via `nbgitpuller` by clicking the link.
3. Complete the assignment at the bottom of the file.
4. Turn in your notebook as the solution for this assignment on MSTeams. For information on how to turn in an assignment with Microsoft Teams, see the [webpage](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-in-an-assignment-in-microsoft-teams-e25f383a-b747-4a0b-b6d5-a2845a52092b).

Please refer to the assignments on Python, Jupyter, and Numpy for further training. Some of you will need to complete these assignments before you can complete this one.
