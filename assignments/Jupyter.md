Numpy Library
Numpy is one of the most commonly used Python libraries for mathematical operations on vectors and matrices (aka linear algebra). It will not only used in our hands-on exercises, tutorials, and assignments in this course (as presented in Week 3 Hands-on Exercises) but also it is used by many computational chemistry Python packages that we are or will be using in this course.

As a result, it is important to take some time and familiarize yourself with Numpy. Please go through:
-	Numpy Introduction from W3Schools: 
https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_intro.asp
This interactive tutorial introduces you to the Numpy library and allows you to run the examples in the browser.
-	These 4 short videos are cherry-picked from LinkedIn Learning to give you an overview of Numpy and teach you how to create, index, and slice arrays and do math with them. The three Jupyter notebooks used are XXX, XXX, and XXX.

This course also teaches you about [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), the library we use for visualization.

Please Note:
1. This course would be the most useful if you have a Jupyter notebook open and try the presented code snippets yourself.
2. Feel free to skip "Numpy, data science, IMQAV" under the "Introduction" section, because it is not relevant to our course.
3. Feel free to skip "Install Software" under the "Introduction" section, because you have already installed Anaconda.
4. Feel free to skip "7. Extended Examples" section, because the examples given are not directly useful for our course, even though they are good Numpy practice cases.
